First Workshop on Analysis of Aerial Motion Imagery (WAAMI)
WAAMI 2020
in conjunction with
25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2020)
Milan, Italy 13|18 September 2020

Description:
In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in aerial motion imagery due to advances in airborne sensor technologies, rising adoption of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and emergence of new applications associated with these technologies including aerial surveillance, traffic monitoring, search and rescue, disaster relief, and precision agriculture. We are witnessing a growing need for robust aerial image and video analysis capabilities to take full advantage of this data and to address the pressing needs of its applications. Novel methods, particularly those relying on artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) approaches, coupled with rapid advances in computational hardware (more powerful, lighter weight, lower energy, lower cost computing platforms) are revolutionizing the image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision fields. 

Topics: 
The aim of this workshop is to solicit papers from academia, government, and industry researchers with original and innovative works on all aspects of analysis of aerial motion imagery to address the needs in a diverse set of application areas. Of particular interest to this workshop is analysis of aerial wide area motion imagery (WAMI) that is characterized by very large (few square miles) ground coverage. WAMI enables large scale surveillance and monitoring for extended periods of time, but suffers from unique challenges such as hundreds to thousands of moving objects per frame, small object sizes, parallax, and lower frame rates.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

Robust feature detection and matching
Aerial video stabilization
Object detection and/or recognition in aerial videos
Multi-object tracking 
Multi-view object tracking
Persistent single object tracking
3D-enabled object tracking
Landmark detection and recognition for aerial navigation
Structure-From-Motion
Aerial 3D reconstruction
Scene understanding and video summarization for aerial platforms
Applications of computer vision for aerial platforms
Embedded video processing for aerial systems
Multi-sensor data fusion for aerial systems
Deep learning for aerial image analysis
Video compression for aerial motion imagery
Synthetic scene generation for aerial applications
Autonomous navigation
Multi-UAV swarm coordination and sensing
